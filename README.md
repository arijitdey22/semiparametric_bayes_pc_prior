This repository contains all code and plots used for the initial plots, Simulation Study and Data Application in **“Semiparametric Generalized Exponential Regression Model with a Principled Distance-based Prior”** by Arijit Dey and Arnab Hazra.

It has two folders: **Simulations** and **Data Application**. The `.R` and `.RData` files are numbered sequentially to follow the workflow. For the simulations, the `.RData` files with MCMC chains produced by `00_All_Sim_Together.R` are **not** included (they total \~150 GB). You’ll need to generate these files locally before proceeding.
